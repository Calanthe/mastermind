The Mastermind game made in Webpack, ES6 and React.

Try to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within ten turns. After submitting a row, a small black peg is placed for each code peg from the guess which is correct in both color and position. A white peg indicates the existence of a correct color code peg placed in the wrong position.
